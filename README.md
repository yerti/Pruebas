## The command interpreter:

The command interpreter is also known as shell or terminal
where it allows us to interact with the operating system by
entering text commands, these commands are used so that instead of using
a graphical interface with windows and menus,
we use commands that are entered through the keyboard.

### How to start it

To be able to start using the terminal or shell depends
on what operating system you are using if it is linux, macOS, windows:

1. On Windows:
   - Press the "Windows + R" keys to open the "Run" dialog.
   - Type "cmd" in the dialog box and press Enter.
   - A Command Prompt window will open.

2. On Linux:
   - Search for and open the "Terminal" application from
     the applications menu or using the search.
   - The command interpreter will open.

3. On macOS:
   - Open the "Finder" application.
   - Navigate to the "Applications" folder.
   - Inside the "Applications" folder, find and open the "Utilities" folder.
   - Inside the "Utilities" folder, double-click the "Terminal" application.
