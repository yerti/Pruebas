## The console  :computer:

The command interpreter is also known as shell or terminal
where it allows us to interact with the operating system by
entering text commands, these commands are used so that instead of using
a graphical interface with windows and menus,
we use commands that are entered through the keyboard.

### How to start it

To be able to start using the terminal or shell depends
on what operating system you are using if it is linux, macOS, windows:

1. On Windows:
   - Press the "Windows + R" keys to open the "Run" dialog.
   - Type "cmd" in the dialog box and press Enter.
   - A Command Prompt window will open.

2. On Linux:
   - Search for and open the "Terminal" application from
     the applications menu or using the search.
   - The command interpreter will open.

3. On macOS:
   - Open the "Finder" application.
   - Navigate to the "Applications" folder.
   - Inside the "Applications" folder, find and open the "Utilities" folder.
   - Inside the "Utilities" folder, double-click the "Terminal" application.
   - A command interpreter (Terminal) window will open.

### How to use it

To start using the shell, follow these steps:

1. Check current location:
   When you open the shell prompt, you'll see a
   line of text showing your current location.
   - Windows: "C:\Users\User>"
   - on macOS/Linux:

2. Run commands:
   You can start executing commands directly at the shell.
   Just type the name of the command and then hit Enter to run it.
   For example, you can use the "dir" command on Windows to view
   the contents of the current directory or "ls" on macOS/Linux to do the same.

   Explore basic commands:
   Some basic commands you can try include:

    - On Windows: dir, cd, mkdir, rmdir, echo, type, cls, etc.
    - On macOS/Linux: ls, cd, mkdir, rm, echo, cat, clear, etc.

3. Get help:
    If you need help with a specific command, you can add the --help or -h
    argument after the command name to get information on how to use it.
    For example, dir --help on Windows or ls --help on macOS/Linux.

4. Exit the command interpreter:

   To exit the shell, you can use the "exit" command on Windows
   or "exit" or "Ctrl + D"Â onÂ macOS/Linux.

### Examples

1. Create and remove directories/files: Use the commands
   mkdir to create directories, rmdir to remove empty directories,
   del to remove files on Windows,Â orÂ rmÂ onÂ Linux.

2. List directory contents: Use the dir command on Windows
   or ls on Linux to view the contents of the currentÂ directory.

3. Copy and move files: You can use copy on Windows and cp
   on Linux to copy files, and move on Windows or mv on LinuxÂ toÂ moveÂ them.

4. Command help: If you have questions about the use
   of a specific command, you can use the /? option. on Windows
   or --help on Linux. For example: command /? orÂ --helpÂ command.
